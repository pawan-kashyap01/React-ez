### What is `NPM`?
NPM is a tool used for package management and the default package manager for Node projects.
It comes with a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the online database of NPM, called the NPM Registry.
`npm init` initializes NPM, and `npm init -y` skips the setup step.

### What is `Parcel/Webpack`?
Parcel/Webpack is a web application bundler used for development and production purposes. 
It offers features like HMR, file watching, caching, image optimization, bundling, compressing,
consistent hashing, code splitting, and differential bundling.

#### Parcel Features:
- HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- File watcher algorithm
- Minification
- DEV and production Build
- Super-fast building algorithm
- Image optimization
- Caching while development
- Compresses
- Compatible with older browser versions
- HTTPS in dev
- Port Number
- Consistent hashing algorithm
- Zero Configuration
- Automatic code splitting

#### Installation commands:
- Install: `npm install -D parcel`
- For development build: `npx parcel <entry_point>`
- For production build: `npx parcel build <entry_point>`

### What is `.parcel-cache`?
`.parcel-cache` is used by Parcel to reduce building time by storing information about the project.

### What is `npx`?
`npx` is a tool used to execute packages without installing them. It comes with npm.

### Dependencies vs. DevDependencies
Dependencies are for libraries/frameworks, while DevDependencies are for development tools. Use `npm install --save-dev` for DevDependencies.

### What is `Tree Shaking`?
Tree shaking is the process of removing unwanted code during optimization.

### What is `Hot Module Replacement`?
HMR exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running without a full reload.

### List down your favorite 5 superpowers of Parcel and describe any 3 of them.
- HMR
- File watcher algorithm
- Minification
- Image optimization
- Caching while development

### What is `.gitignore`?
`.gitignore` is a file specifying files or folders to ignore in Git. It helps prevent unnecessary files from being committed.

### Difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
`package.json` contains basic project information, while `package-lock.json` is automatically generated and records specific dependency versions for consistency.

### Why should I not modify `package-lock.json`?
Modifying `package-lock.json` could lead to dependency issues. It is automatically managed by npm.

### What is `node_modules`? Is it a good idea to push that on git?
`node_modules` is a folder containing external modules. It is not recommended to push it to GitHub due to its large size.

### What is the `dist` folder?
The `dist` folder contains the minimized version of the source code used in production.

### What is `browserslist`?
`Browserslist` allows specifying supported browsers for your frontend app. It is used by frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.
